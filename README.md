# Fleetspeak

Fleetspeak is a framework for communicating with a fleet of machines, with a
focus on security monitoring and basic administrative use cases.  It is a
subproject of [GRR](https://github.com/google/grr/blob/master/README.md), and
can be seen as an effort to modularizing and modernizing its communication
mechanism.

## Status

We have this code working internally as part of our GRR installation. Over the
next weeks to months we will be organizing our open source development process,
building out installation processes and otherwise preparing for broader external
use, both as part of GRR and for other uses.

To get started with a basic stand-along configuration, you might try to follow
the directions in our
[demo directory](https://github.com/google/fleetspeak/tree/master/fleetspeak/src/demo).

## DISCLAIMER

While the code presented here is in some sense feature complete, much of it is
barely tested or documented, and breaking changes are still possible.
Therefore, please consider this a preview release while the dust settles.
Suggestions and pull requests are very much appreciated.
